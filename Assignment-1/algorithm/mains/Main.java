 * In the book : "Introduction to Java Programming," by Liang (10th ed),
 * "Note: If you use an IDE such as Eclipse or NetBeans, 
 * you will get a warning to ask you to close the input to prevent a potential resource leak
 * Ignore the warning because the input is automatically closed when your program is terminated. 
 * In this case, there will be no resource leaking." (page 39)
