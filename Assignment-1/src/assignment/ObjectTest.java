/**
 * This class is a test : There are two type of classes, the classes that implement interfaces, and that are the road of the algorithm we need to follow.
 * The second type is the classes that represent object, like wifi, scan, line, csvFile, mac, macLocation...
 * The question is does we need a mother class to all the object ?
 * This could help about the generic and in the case we need interface with arrayList which contains object.
 * TODO : Check this.
